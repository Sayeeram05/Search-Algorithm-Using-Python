  <h1>Search Algorithm üîç</h1>
  <p>Searching algorithms are essential tools in computer science used to locate specific items within a collection of data. These algorithms are designed to efficiently navigate through data structures to find the desired information, making them fundamental in various applications such as databases, web search engines, and more.</p>

  <h2>‚≠ê Linear Search</h2>
  <p>Linear Search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found otherwise, the search continues till the end of the data set.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>‚≠ê Binary Search</h2>
  <p>Binary Search is defined as a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>‚≠ê Front And Back Search</h2>
  <p>Front And Back Search Algorithm is a variant of linear search where you start searching from both ends of the sorted array towards the middle simultaneously, aiming to reduce the search space faster than a traditional linear search.</p>
